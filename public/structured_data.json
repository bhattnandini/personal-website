        "abstract": "In this era of technological advancement, all the sectors, including primary health care, have been upgraded to their pinnacle with fascinating tools and systems that actually make the process of saving a patient’s life somewhat easier than it used to be. Medical records typically consist of self-reported patient information along with doctor’s notes on diagnoses, and treatments. But there’s so much more to it. Up-to-date medical records generally contain self-reported detail such as contact and demographic information, lifestyle habits, medical history, vaccination information, and past test results. The primary reason why accurate and up- to-date medical records are super essential is that THEY CAN SAVE LIVES DURING EMERGENCIES. In this study, we aim to present a system that helps doctors get the necessary details of patients beforehand. So in case of an emergency, based on these essential data, the doctors can decide and start preparing the pieces of equipment and medicines before it’s too late. If the health parameters cross a pre-determined threshold value, a notification will be sent through an email or an SMS."
